In the maindebug.c file, you can  read comment lines for having better understanding.                    
You can see some test codes here.                 

main.c file includes simplified codes, you can run it directly. I recommed to follow this file,               
you can take a look at the corresponding line in the maindebug.c file, if you get stuck.                   
 
Also, you can find orientation test file and communication test file to test your communication line             
and adxl345's hardware relaiblity(if it is damaged, malfunction).          

You can find information about SPI configuration and working principle in adxl345.c file.
